        This method blocks until the camera has finished applying the network configuration, or raises an exception if
        the camera does not reappear on the network before a timeout occurs.

        This method can be used even if the camera is inaccessible via TCP/IP, for example a camera that is on a
        different subnet to the PC, or a camera with an IP conflict, as it uses UDP multicast to communicate with the
        camera.

        This method can also be used to configure cameras that require a firmware update, as long as the firmware
        supports network configuration via UDP multicast. This has been supported on all firmware versions included
        with SDK 2.10.0 or newer. This method will raise an exception if the camera firmware is too old to support
        UDP multicast.

        This method will raise an exception if the camera status (see CameraState.Status) is "busy", "connected",
        "connecting" or "disconnecting". If the status is "connected", then you must first call disconnect() before
